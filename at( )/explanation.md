ECMAScript 2022 (ES13) introduced a new method called at() for arrays. This method allows you to easily retrieve values from an array without having to use index-based access. Instead of accessing array elements using numbers, you can now use the at() method.

The at() method takes an index (a position in the array) as its input. When you use at() with a specific index, it will give you the value stored at that position in the array. This means you can easily retrieve the value of the last element, the first element, or any element in the middle of the array using this method. It simplifies the process of accessing array elements and makes it more convenient for developers.

 # Accessing Array Elements with 🍎

Let's say we have an array called `fruitBasket` with some fruits:

```javascript
const fruitBasket = ["apple", "guava", "banana", "grapes", "orange"];

To print messages to the console, we define a print function:
javascript

const print = console.log.bind(console);

🥇 Accessing the first element: 🍏

To access the first element in the array, you can use fruitBasket[0]. This will give you 🍎 "apple".
javascript

print(fruitBasket[0]);  // Output: 🍎 apple

🥴 Avoiding undefined with negative indices: ❌

Using negative indices in brackets, like fruitBasket[-1], will result in undefined. Negative indices are not valid in JavaScript arrays.
javascript

print(fruitBasket[-1]);  // Output: ❌ undefined

🥈 Accessing the last element: 🍊

To access the last element using traditional indexing, you can use fruitBasket[fruitBasket.length - 1]. This will give you 🍊 "orange".
javascript

print(fruitBasket[fruitBasket.length - 1]);  // Output: 🍊 orange

🚀 Simplifying access with the at() method: ✨

ECMAScript 2022 introduced the at() method for arrays. By calling fruitBasket.at(-1), you can directly retrieve the last element, which is 🍊 "orange". The -1 index represents the last element in the array, regardless of its length.
javascript

print(fruitBasket.at(-1));  // Output: 🍊 orange

🔥 Accessing the second-to-last element: 🍇

Similarly, fruitBasket.at(-2) allows you to access the second-to-last element in the array, which is 🍇 "grapes".
javascript

print(fruitBasket.at(-2));  // Output: 🍇 grapes

Using the at() method with negative indices provides a convenient way to access elements from the end of an array without needing to calculate the exact index based on the array length. 🎉
