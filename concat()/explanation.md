The `concat()` method in JavaScript is used to merge two or more arrays or strings, creating a new array or string with the combined elements. It was introduced in ECMAScript 1 (ES1) and has been part of JavaScript since its inception.

-Merging Arrays: concat() merges arrays and strings, returning a new array containing the elements from all the arrays. Original arrays remain untouched.

-Shallow Copy: It creates a new array by copying element references, not the elements themselves. Changes to original array elements after merging won't affect the concatenated array, and vice versa.
