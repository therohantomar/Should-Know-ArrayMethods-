## :ballot_box_with_check: Array.prototype.every()

The `every()` method is available in ECMAScript 5 (ES5) and can be used on arrays. It iterates over each element of the array and applies a callback function to test a specific condition. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the array satisfy the provided condition.

```javascript
:memo: **Syntax**

array.every((element, index, array) => {
  // condition to test
});


1: element: The current element being processed.
2: index: The index of the current element.
3: array: The array on which the every() method was called.
The callback function takes three parameters: element, index, and array. Within the callback function, you can define the condition that each element should satisfy.

âžœ Return Value

The every() method returns true if all elements in the array satisfy the condition specified by the callback function. If any element fails to satisfy the condition, the method returns false.

ðŸš€ Example Usage

const numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];

const allEven = numbers.every((element) => {
  return element % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(allEven); // Output: true
In this example, the every() method checks if all elements in the numbers array are even. The condition element % 2 === 0 is used to test if each element is divisible by 2. Since all elements satisfy this condition, the every() method returns true.
